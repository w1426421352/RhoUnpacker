A lightweight, high-performance command-line utility for unpacking `.rho` and `.rho5` asset files from the game KartRider. This tool is built with .NET 8 Native AOT, resulting in a single, dependency-free executable that is ideal for automation and scripting.

## Features

* **Native Performance**: Compiled with .NET 8 Native AOT to produce a fast, single, native executable.
* **Zero Dependencies**: Requires no .NET runtime to be installed on the target machine. It's truly 'plug-and-play'.
* **Lightweight & Simple**: A minimalist tool focused exclusively on unpacking, making it fast and reliable.
* **Script-Friendly**: A clean command-line interface designed for easy integration into automated workflows and scripts.
* **Platform Support**: This version targets `win-x64` (Windows 64-bit).

## Getting Started

The easiest way to use RhoUnpacker is to download the latest pre-compiled binary from the official releases page.

### [**>> Download the Latest Release Here <<**](https://github.com/w1426421352/RhoUnpacker/releases/latest)

Download the `RhoUnpacker-v...-win-x64.zip` file, extract it anywhere on your computer, and you are ready to go.

## Usage

This is a command-line tool that accepts two arguments: the path to the input file and the path to the output directory.

**Command Syntax:**
```bash
RhoUnpacker.exe <path_to_input_file.rho> <path_to_output_directory>
````

**Example:**

```bash
# Unpacks the track_common.rho file into the D:\KartRider_Unpacked\track_common directory
RhoUnpacker.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\TianCity\PopKart\M01\Data\track_common.rho" "D:\KartRider_Unpacked\track_common"
```

## Building from Source

If you wish to build the project yourself, you will need:

  * .NET 8 SDK
  * Visual Studio 2022 (or newer) with the "Desktop development with C++" workload installed (required for Native AOT linking).

**Steps:**

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/w1426421352/RhoUnpacker.git`
2.  Open the `KartTools.sln` file in Visual Studio.
3.  Build the solution by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+B`.
4.  To publish the Native AOT executable, open a developer command prompt, navigate to the `RhoUnpacker` project directory, and run:
    ```bash
    dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64
    ```
    The final executable will be in the `bin\Release\net8.0\win-x64\publish\` directory.

## Acknowledgements

The code implementation for the core unpacking library, `KartLibrary`, is sourced directly from **yanygm**'s `Kartrider-File-Reader` project.

This project is a fork that builds upon and enhances the original work by **xpoi5010**. The modifications made by yanygm were crucial for making the library easy to integrate into this tool.

Sincere thanks to **xpoi5010** for the foundational work, and to **yanygm** for the key improvements and accessibility.
